## 🚀 Overview
“Stationery for Mail” is designed for macOS users who want to personalize their email communication with elegance and style. Rather than sending plain, default messages in Apple Mail, this app provides a suite of beautifully crafted email templates (“stationery”) that help your messages stand out.  

Templates are designed for a variety of occasions—friendly greetings, holiday cards, business introductions, invitations, and personal notes. The visual polish—background textures, elegant borders, themed headers—gives your emails a touch of personality.  

Moreover, it simplifies the process: select a template, compose your message, and send—all without worrying about manual formatting or design consistency. For individuals and small businesses alike, Stationery for Mail transforms simple emails into aesthetically pleasing, brand-consistent communication.

## ℹ️ About (Deep Dive)
Stationery has been part of Apple Mail’s charm for years, but its built-in library is limited. This product expands the possibilities, offering a comprehensive template pack with flexible design and customization options:  

- **Diverse Template Styles**  
  From classic and elegant to modern and playful—stationery sets include occasions such as birthdays, holidays, weddings, business announcements, thank you notes, and seasonal themes.

- **Custom Backgrounds & Colors**  
  Templates allow you to customize backgrounds, color palettes, borders, and header graphics, so the stationery reflects your personal or brand style.

- **Header & Footer Branding**  
  Add your logo, signature, or custom footer to stationery so every outgoing email carries consistent branding or personal touch.

- **Built-in Layouts**  
  Templates come with pre-formatted text blocks for salutations, content area, images, and signatures, making it easy to drop content without worrying about alignment or spacing.

- **High-Resolution Assets**  
  Images and textures provided in stationery templates are optimized for retina displays while keeping email size reasonable; formats ensure compatibility across devices.

- **User-Friendly Integration**  
  Templates integrate smoothly with Apple Mail—stationery can be selected when composing messages, and the style is preserved on both sending and receiving ends when possible.

This kit helps you maintain elegance and consistency in your communications, whether personal or professional.
